Léandre : Who’s there ?
Daelen : It’s me, my love.
Léandre : Daelen ! What are you doing here ? If you mother found out--
Daelen : My mother is a monster who took your eyes because of jealousy.
I will never go back to her castle.
Léandre : You can’t be serious. Queen Syphoria will send her horrendous goblins after us.
And without my eyes, I can barely protect myself, let alone protect you…
Daelen : Then we shall escape together. I would rather flee forever by your side than live
in a world where my own mother killed the love of my life...
Léandre : … So be it. Tonight, we will find freedom far from the kingdom of Galandr, far from your mother.
Daelen : As long as we’re together, anything is possible.
Come now, my love, hand in hand we will escape from this terrible kingdom.
